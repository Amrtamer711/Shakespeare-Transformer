# Shakespeare Transformer
# Overview:
A character level transformer model that takes N number of previous characters to predict the next charcater. It takes a text file of Shakespeare and produces new "Shakspeare-like" text. It can be easily changed with any other type of text data as long as it has a regular pattern that can be picked up by the transformer.
